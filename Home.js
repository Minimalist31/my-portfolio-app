          Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Saumya, a budding Web Developer eager to bring fresh
          ideas and a passion for coding to the digital playground. Although I
          may be a newcomer, my energy and commitment to learning are unmatched.
          Being a BCA student from Presidency College and a tech enthusiast,
          I've dived headfirst into the world of web development during my
          academic journey. From building my first website to exploring the
          latest frameworks, I'm on a quest to turn every challenge into a
          learning opportunity. I believe in the power of collaboration and the
          endless possibilities of technology. Let's embark on this coding
          adventure together and create something extraordinary! <br></br>
